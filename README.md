# html5-beat-sequencer
My personal shot onto an HTML5 drum computer written in HTML5 and javascript using a few front-end resources like scss and jquery.

I will try to maintain this project as a fun personal side project. I have no plans for the future with this app, it is mainly just myself fiddling around with a wide variety of native javascript api's and future front-end resources such as scss. I'm aiming to write clean code in a modular base.

## installing
If you are curious what's inside this package (haven't tested plug and playing this project though), you can clone it to your computer. once cloned, fire up the command line and cd into the cloned folder and hit npm install. (if you get errors, please take a look at https://www.npmjs.com/ for installation details) This should install all the Node dependencies such as gulp etc (gulp may need some additional installs - sass for example, try to follow the terminal guidance). If npm is done, just hit npm start - this will execute the start task which boots up an instance of nodemon in the server directory to run express and gulp in the same session, so you won't need to worry about firing up several processes. once done, navigate to localhost:1234 and voila. there is my project :) if anything seems wrong or not correct, try to find out if everything has been compiled as it should.
